# ImageSliderPrototype

Image slider prototype is the prototype android app that picks up images from a sdcard folder "PI-Images" and 
display them as grid. On touching any image in the grid,a fullscreen image slider opens with pinch zoom function.
The base code has been taken from a tutorial by Ravi Tamada available at 
androidhive - http://www.androidhive.info/2013/09/android-fullscreen-image-slider-with-swipe-and-pinch-zoom-gestures/
I have added the missing classes and made image slider fullscreen.
